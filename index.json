Event cameras provide an alternative visual representation with a much higher dynamic range and temporal resolution free from the above issues, which could be an effective guidance for HDR imaging from LDR videos. In this paper, we propose a multimodal learning framework for event guided HDR video reconstruction. In order to better leverage the knowledge of the same scene from the two modalities of visual signals, a multimodal representation alignment strategy to learn a shared latent space and a fusion module tailored to complementing two types of signals for different dynamic ranges in different regions are proposed. Temporal correlations are utilized recurrently to suppress the flickering effects in the reconstructed HDR video. The proposed HDRev-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively for both synthetic and real-world data.\nAnimated Results BibTex @inproceedings{ yang2023HDRev, title={Learning Event Guided High Dynamic Range Video Reconstruction}, author={Yixin Yang, Jin Han, Jinxiu Liang, Imari Sato, Boxin Shi}, booktitle={Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2023}, year={2023} } ","date":1678492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678492800,"objectID":"efc13a4a60a9ef7c480cf9b37d6c61b5","permalink":"https://yixinyang-00.github.io/project/hdrev/","publishdate":"2023-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hdrev/","section":"project","summary":"We propose a multimodal learning framework for event guided HDR video reconstruction, which including multimodal representation alignment, confidence guided multimodal fusion and temporal context encoding.
